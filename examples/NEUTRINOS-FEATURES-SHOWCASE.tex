The Neutrinos name satisfies this requirement while maintaining clear connection to the Latin Modern heritage and acknowledging the source of the exceptional typographic quality.

\subsection{Neutrinos Enhancements and Branding}

While the base font data inherits the GUST Font License from Latin Modern, the Neutrinos name and specialized features represent proprietary intellectual property of Neutrinos Platforms Incorporated. This dual licensing structure allows free distribution of the fonts consistent with GUST Font License requirements while protecting the Neutrinos brand and specialized feature implementations. Users may employ and redistribute the fonts freely but may not claim the Neutrinos brand or represent derivative works as official Neutrinos products without authorization.

\subsection{Attribution Requirements}

Proper attribution acknowledges both the Latin Modern source and Neutrinos enhancements. Documents and applications employing Neutrinos fonts should include appropriate acknowledgment of the font derivation and licensing terms. Recommended attribution includes the font name and version, acknowledgment of Latin Modern Roman source, credit to GUST e-foundry and original designers, acknowledgment of Neutrinos Platforms Incorporated for enhancements, and reference to GUST Font License terms.
